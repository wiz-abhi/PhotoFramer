## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#B0E2FF) to give a sense of calmness and sophistication, like high-end photography and design.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E6F7FF), almost white, of similar hue as primary, creating a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft purple (#D0BFFF) as a non-jarring contrast with light blue and an invitation to creative workflows.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, will be used for headings and body text to ensure clarity and modern aesthetics.
- Use clean, minimalist icons for upload, layout selection, and print functions.
- Maintain clear margins and padding around images and layout sections for a professional, uncluttered look.
- Use subtle transitions and animations when dragging and dropping images, and when switching between layouts, for enhanced user experience.
